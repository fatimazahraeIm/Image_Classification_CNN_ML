# Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating image classification using different neural network architectures in TensorFlow.

## Notebooks

### 1. Image Classification using MLP in TensorFlow
- **File**: [Image_Classification_using_MLP_in_Tensorflow.ipynb](Image_Classification_using_MLP_in_Tensorflow.ipynb)
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates image classification using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images. The model is built using the `Sequential` API from TensorFlow's Keras library and includes layers such as `Flatten` and `Dense`.

### 2. Image Classification using CNN in TensorFlow
- **File**: [Images_Classification_using_CNN.ipynb](Images_Classification_using_CNN.ipynb)
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The dataset used is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The model is built using the Functional API from TensorFlow's Keras library and includes layers such as `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Dense`.
